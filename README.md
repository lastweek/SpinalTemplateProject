## TODO

- how to do simulation
- how to know the performance of generated RTL?
   - II?
   - frequency limit?
   - do we have to use Vivado to know?
- how to build FIFOs to chain internal functions?
- how to use AXI-Stream/AXI4 to talk to outside?
- how to use BRAM/UltraRAM?
- how to use external DRAM properly, i.e., how to use axi-stream/axi4 properly?
